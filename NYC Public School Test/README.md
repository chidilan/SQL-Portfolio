     2. Brooklyn Latin School (625)
     3. Leon M. Goldstein High School for the Sciences (563)

## Observations

The data reveals significant disparities in academic performance across NYC schools. A small number of specialized high schools account for most of the top scores, while many schools struggle with much lower averages. The borough-level analysis shows that Staten Island, despite having far fewer schools, outperforms larger boroughs - this may warrant further investigation into factors like school funding, student demographics, or testing participation rates.

The concentration of high-performing schools in certain areas (particularly Manhattan and Staten Island) could have implications for educational equity and access to quality education across the city.
