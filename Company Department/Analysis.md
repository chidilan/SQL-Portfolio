# **HR Analytics: Employee Compensation & Retention Analysis**  

## **Problem Statement**  
The company has observed **high turnover rates** in certain departments, particularly **Sales and Marketing**, while **HR remains stable**. Leadership suspects that **salary disparities, onboarding trends, and client assignments** may be contributing factors.  

### **Key Questions:**  
1. Are certain departments underpaid compared to others?  
2. Which employees are at risk of leaving due to low compensation?  
3. Does onboarding date impact retention?  
4. Are high-performing employees clustered in specific client companies?  
5. How can we optimize compensation to improve retention?

## **Analytical Approach**

3. **Client Impact** – Determine if certain client companies correlate with higher salaries.  
4. **Retention Risk Scoring** – Flag employees with below-average salaries and short tenure.  
5. **Equity Adjustments** – Recommend salary adjustments for fairness.
