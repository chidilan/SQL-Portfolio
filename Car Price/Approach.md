# Navigating the Road of Automotive Costs: A Data Analysis Requirement Document

**1. Introduction**

This document outlines the requirements for a data analysis project focused on understanding the factors that influence car prices over time. The automotive industry is characterized by dynamic pricing influenced by a complex interplay of economic, technological, and consumer-driven factors. This analysis aims to gain insights into how these factors, such as inflation, technological advancements, and changing consumer preferences, have shaped the price trajectories of different vehicle segments.

**2. Project Objectives**

* **Understand the impact of inflation on car prices:** Quantify the effect of inflation on vehicle prices across different segments and over time.
* **Analyze the influence of technological advancements:** Investigate the relationship between the introduction of new technologies (e.g., safety features, autonomous driving capabilities) and corresponding price increases.
* **Examine the role of consumer demand:** Analyze how changes in consumer preferences (e.g., shifts in demand for SUVs, electric vehicles) have impacted vehicle prices.
* **Identify key drivers of price variation:** Determine the most significant factors contributing to price fluctuations within and across different vehicle segments.
* **Develop predictive models:** Explore the possibility of building predictive models to forecast future car prices based on identified factors.

**3. Data Requirements**

* **Historical vehicle sales data:** 
    * Vehicle model and year 
    * Manufacturer 
    * Segment (e.g., sedan, SUV, truck)
    * MSRP (Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price)
    * Sales volume
    * Key features and specifications (e.g., engine size, horsepower, fuel type, safety features)
* **Inflation data:** Consumer Price Index (CPI) or other relevant inflation metrics.
* **Technological advancement data:** 
    * Timeline of major technological introductions in the automotive industry (e.g., ABS, airbags, electric vehicles)
    * Adoption rates of key technologies
* **Consumer demand data:** 
    * Market research data on consumer preferences and trends
    * Sales data for different vehicle segments over time 

**4. Analysis Methods**

* **Descriptive statistics:** Calculate mean, median, standard deviation, and other relevant statistics to summarize price trends.
* **Time series analysis:** Analyze price trends over time to identify patterns, seasonality, and trends.
* **Regression analysis:** 
    * Build regression models to quantify the impact of inflation, technological advancements, and other factors on car prices.
    * Consider multiple regression models to assess the combined influence of various factors.
* **Segmentation analysis:** Analyze price trends within different vehicle segments (e.g., compare price changes for sedans, SUVs, and trucks).
* **Market basket analysis:** (Optional) Analyze the relationship between specific features and their impact on vehicle price.

**5. Deliverables**

* **Data analysis report:** 
    * Executive summary summarizing key findings.
    * Detailed analysis of data, including visualizations and statistical results.
    * Interpretation of findings and insights into the factors driving car price changes.
    * Recommendations for future research or potential applications of the findings.
* **Data visualizations:** 
    * Charts and graphs illustrating key trends and relationships.
    * Interactive dashboards (optional) for exploring the data interactively.

**6. Tools and Technologies**
