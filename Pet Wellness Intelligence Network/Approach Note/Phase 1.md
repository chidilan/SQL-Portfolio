# **Approach Note: IoT Data Aggregation & Chaos**  
### **Objective**  
To integrate real-time pet activity data from IoT smart collars with fragmented veterinary records across three incompatible systems, enabling seamless access to pet health insights.  

---

## **Key Challenges & Solutions**  

### **1. Sensor Dropouts (20% nightly disconnections)**  
**Challenge:**  
- Smart collars frequently lose connection, causing data gaps in pet activity tracking.  

**Solution:**  
- Implement **Bluetooth Mesh Networking** to enhance connectivity and reduce dropout rates.  
- Store and sync offline data once the connection is restored.  

**Action Plan:**  
✅ Conduct signal strength analysis to identify weak spots.  
✅ Deploy a mesh network between multiple collars to relay data efficiently.  

---

### **2. Legacy Electronic Health Record (EHR) Integration**  
**Challenge:**  
- Vet records are stored as **handwritten notes or scanned PDFs** from the 1990s, making structured data extraction difficult.  

**Solution:**  
- Develop a **Python OCR pipeline** using **pytesseract** and **pdf2image** to digitize legacy records.  
- Implement **natural language processing (NLP)** and regex parsing to extract key medical terms.  

**Action Plan:**  
✅ Process **10,000+ historical records** and store them in a structured **SQL database**.  
✅ Validate extracted data against manual samples to ensure **90%+ accuracy**.  

**Code Snippet (OCR Extraction):**  
```python  
import pytesseract  
from pdf2image import convert_from_path  

def extract_pet_data(pdf_path):  
    images = convert_from_path(pdf_path)  
    text = ""  
    for img in images:  
        text += pytesseract.image_to_string(img, config='--psm 11')  
    return parse_medical_text(text)  # Custom regex function  

# Usage example  
pdf_path = 'fluffy_2019.pdf'  
health_data = extract_pet_data(pdf_path)  
```

## **Data Architecture & Pipeline**  

1. **Data Sources:**  
   - IoT **collar sensors** (activity, weight, licking behavior).  
   - Legacy **PDF-based vet records**.  
   - **Existing clinic databases** (appointment logs, treatment history).  

2. **Processing Layers:**  
   - **OCR Pipeline** → Converts PDFs into structured data.  
   - **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) Process** → Cleans and normalizes data.  
   - **SQL Database** → Centralized repository storing **500K+ pet profiles**.  

3. **Output & Integration:**  
   - Unified **SQL database** accessible to **vets, AI models, and dashboards**.  
   - **API Layer** to enable seamless clinic system integration.

## **Expected Deliverables**  
✅ Fully digitized **historical pet records** for streamlined vet access.  
✅ **Real-time IoT data ingestion pipeline** with improved connectivity.  
✅ **Unified database** supporting predictive health analytics.

## **Impact**  
📉 **Reduced vet consultation time** (15 min → 5 min per visit).  
📈 **Improved collar data reliability** (dropout rate reduced by 60%).  
💾 **500K+ pet health records digitized**, unlocking predictive analytics for pet care.  

This phase sets the foundation for **predictive health alerts and personalized wellness plans**, ensuring every pet gets **data-driven care, not guesswork**.
